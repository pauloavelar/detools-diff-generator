# Diff Generator

Steps:

1. Paste all binary files into the `files` directory, **version-ordered alphabetically**.
2. Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the generator with `python3 diff.py`.
4. Look for the generated files in the `out` directory.

> Keep the filenames short, they will be used as part of the names on the generated files.
